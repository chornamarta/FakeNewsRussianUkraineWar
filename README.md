## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a given piece of text. In this project, I leverage BERT, a powerful neural network architecture, to perform sentiment analysis and specifically target the identification of fake news related to the Russian-Ukrainian war.

## Installation
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/chornamarta/FakeNewsRussianUkraineWar.git`
2. Make sure you have installed Anaconda and Python

## Usage
To use the sentiment analysis model, you can follow these steps:
1. Preprocess your text data (refer to the [Preprocessing](#preprocessing) section for details).
2. Train the BERT-based sentiment analysis model (refer to the [Model Training](#model-training) section for details).
3. Evaluate the performance of the trained model (refer to the [Evaluation](#evaluation) section for details).
4. Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new text data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of news articles related to the Russian-Ukrainian war. The dataset is labeled with 0 and 1, which is real and fake news accordingly. 

## Model Training
The sentiment analysis model is trained using the BERT neural network architecture. BERT is a state-of-the-art model that has achieved excellent results on various NLP tasks. The training script in this repository provides an example of how to fine-tune the BERT model on your sentiment analysis dataset.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis model, various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are computed. These metrics provide insights into the model's effectiveness in classifying sentiment correctly. The evaluation script in this repository can be used to assess the model's performance on your dataset.

## Future Improvements
There are several areas for potential improvement in this project, such as:
- Adding more data to dataset to improve neural network`s metrics
- Experimenting with different hyperparameter settings to optimize model performance.
